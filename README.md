# RTW1920 | Marvel Quiz
First concept of my real-time application. The idea is to create a Kahoot like quiz game where the Marvel API is used to retrieve certain data. Players will be able to sign in, when the quiz starts it shall display a Marvel character. The players will have to guess the Marvel character, this will probably be multiple choice.

## Features
- Multiplayer quiz
- Achieve points if correct
- Display score at the end of quiz


## API
Data of characters that players have to guess is retrieved from the [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/).

## Data Life Cycle
